        <p> I have had the opportunity to be involved in various projects 
            and development work related to digitalization at Kuopio 
            University Hospital and later in the Wellbeing Services County of North Savo, 
            as well as in national development related to the Health Village.fi website. 
            Below, I briefly introduce some projects.

        <h2>Mobile care path for patients undergoing surgical operation</h2>
        <p> KYS mobile care path offers information and support for patient 
        waiting for operaton and afterwords. It provides a secure communication system
        between patient and healthcare. The interactive timeline in the app provides 
        patients with instructions precisely when they need them. The chronological order 
        of events makes it easy for patients to follow everything that needs to be 
        completed thourough the care path. The app was developed together with Buddy HealthCare.</p>
        <p>Some of the key ideas, lessons and working methods of this project: 
            modeling and digitizing the process of surgical patients, 
            expertise work, collaboration with various stakeholders,
            workshop-based work, 
            collecting feedback from clients, continuous development. 
            Additionally: privacy practices, accessibility, testing, 
            validation, documentation, publishing the mobile application 
            in app store.  </p>

        <h2>Process modeling enables better analysis and development of healthcare operations</h2>
        <p> At the Kuopio University Hospital, a surgical handbook 
            project was carried out during the years 2022-2023, 
            during which we documented and developed the pre-, peri-, and 
            post-operative care of surgical patients. Throughout the project, 
            in multidisciplinary development workshops, we increased 
            understanding, standardized procedures, and devised improvement 
            measures to enhance surgical operations. For process documentation, 
            we utilized the Arter IMS process modeling software available 
            in our region, along with a guidelines management system. </p>

            <p>Some of the key ideas, lessons and working methods of this project: 
            facilitation of workgroups and virtual facilitation using the
            Howspace platform, working with Miro boards, establishment and collaboration 
            with the Surgery Customer Advisory Board. </p> 

            <p>Later, in relation to this, I have learned process mining and automation 
            using <a href="https://www.uipath.com/"> Uipath</a> and <a href="https://www.celonis.com/">Celonis</a> environments. </p>

        <h2>Health Village My Path is a digital service channel for healthcare and social welfare</h2>
        <p> At Kuopio University Hospital and later on at Wellbeing Services 
            County of North Savo, we have been building digital care pathways for 
            several specialties. The platform utilized has been Health Village My Path. 
            I have been involved in developing a digital care pathway for patients 
            with severe heart conditions, for patients 
            with coronary artery disease, and most recently 
            for residents in our well-being area with vascular diseases.
            The development has always involved a multidisciplinary working group, 
            as well as actively engaging patients. </p>
            <p>Some of the key ideas, lessons and working methods of this project:
            he digitalization of care pathways, development and elaboration 
            of digital care pathways on the SharePoint platform,
            considering accessibility, customer participation, establishment and collaboration 
            with Customer Advisory Board regarding digitalization, customer feedback, 
            digital skills training, facilitation of workshops, writing blogs, 
            data protection, process approval, testing, and monitoring related to medical devices.

        <h2>Health Village offers information and support for everyone, 
            care for patients and tools for professionals </h2>
        <p> Health Village is a public online service developed 
            by Finnish university hospitals. Its content is produced 
            by social and healthcare professionals. HealthVillage.fi 
            contains 33 virtual hubs built around different themes. 
            During my project, content related to heart failure was 
            produced for the Heart Disease Hub. Additionally, 
            within the framework of Health Village development 
            and the Heart Disease Hub, national collaboration continues. </p>
